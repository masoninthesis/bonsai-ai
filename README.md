# Bonsai AI WordPress Plugin

Bonsai AI is a powerful WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to inject data into prompts, and generate AI responses using OpenAI API through the Gravity Forms OpenAI plugin.

Currently Bonsai AI is hard-coded to work with bonsai.so to build the Sensei AI functionality. SenseiOS will eventually breakaway to become an add-on, but for now this is the core functionality of the Bonsai AI plugin.

Sensei AI: The functionality to subscribe to a SenseiOS, then ask the AI model questions, create a post with those responses, and start a chat thread. For aspiring Senseis, it gives you the ability to sign up as a Sensei and start training your SenseiOS model.

SenseiOS: An OpenAI model with a layer of Bonsai data on top of it, that gets injected into the prompts contextually, so that it can respond similar to or better than the real person.
